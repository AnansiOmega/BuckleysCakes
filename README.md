# Buckleys Cakes

Buckleys Cakes is website built for a Baker. The purpose of this website is to boost Online Exposure, and showcase their wide degree of skill when it comes to baking.

The technologies used to build this application are: React, react-router, Email.js, headroom.js, multi-carousel, and Flickr API.

I took the challenge of incorporating Creative Tim's Agon Design Sytem to stylize the application. Learning to understand and make sense of how components, and pages are styled. Following along with those systems was incredibly difficult, and in the end I'm incredibily happy with how it turned out.

Got a question, comment, or some feedback? Let me know!
